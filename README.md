# calltech
CallTech is used by various organizations to check which technician can take the work, by reaching out to the phone numbers provided in the system, especially after hours, during holidays and natural disasters. CallTech consists of two major components. One is the web interface to configure Office, Manager and Technician data and for creating callouts which initiate the auto call. The other component is a Java-based backend program that automates the calling process for calling the technicians required for each callout. It uses REST API provided by a third-party vendor for calling technicians and getting their responses back.
